title: Synchronous or not synchronous

## Synchronous or not synchronous?

My friend [Emily Kahm] (https://www.csm.edu/academics/meet-theology-faculty) plays an awesome "game" in her classroom, called _Bible or Not Bible?_ where she invites students in her undergraduate _Introduction to Theology_ class to guess whether a certain text is actually found in the Bible or not. Among other things, this activity does a nice job of complicating the students' ideas of what "Bible" is, what it includes, what it means.

Similarly, I'm curious whether folks would think of the following as either synchronous or not-synchronous -- and, what we can learn about the label by thinking about where we would apply it.

#### Texting
- Sending a text to a friend and not knowing where they are or when they'll respond
- Sending a text to a friend, knowing where they are, but not knowing when they'll respond
- Sending a text to a friend, knowing they saw it, but not knowing when they'll respond
- Sending a text to a company and not knowing if they'll respond
- Receiving a text from your boss
- Receiving a text from a friend
- Watching the ... indicate that your friend is texting you
- Receiving a text from a friend that says "I'm out front ready to pick you up"
- Receiving a text while driving and siri reads it outload to you
- Receiving a text and viewing just the first few words on your apple watch
- Receiving a text that is just a photo, no words
- Texting back and forth with a friend quickly
- Texting back and forth with a friend slowly
- Sending an angry text
- Receiving an angry text
- Sending an "I love you" text 
- Receiving an "I love you" text
- Hearing the ping of a text and not knowing who it's from
- Hearing the ping of a text and knowing who it's from

#### Marco Polo
(_Marco Polo, or "polo," is a video chat app that is not restrained by time, sort of like texting with videos_)
- Sending a polo
- Being notified that you have a polo but not watching it yet
- Watching a polo that is already fully recorded 
- Watching a polo that is still being recorded
- Watching a polo "live"
- Poloing back and forth
- Knowing a friend has seen your polo (but has not yet replied)
- Knowing a friend is currently watching a polo you recorded earlier
- Knowing a friend is currently watching a polo as you are recording it
- Knowing a friend has "been active" on polo

#### Zoom
- Zoom video with a friend or two
- Zoom video with a large group
- Zoom video with screen sharing, cameras turned off
- Zoom video that is stuttering or freezing, a bad connection
- Using the zoom chat function during a large group video call
- Being in a zoom breakout room and thinking about people in different rooms
